</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Class is a blue print which reflects the entities attributes and actions. Technically defining a class is designing an user defined data type.</p>

<p>Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical and Hybrid.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is the role of protected access specifier?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>If a class member is protected then it is accessible in the inherited class. However, outside the both the private and protected members are not accessible.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is encapsulation?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The process of binding the data and the functions acting on the data together in an entity (class) called as encapsulation.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is abstraction?</label>

<p>Abstraction refers to hiding the internal implementation and exhibiting only the necessary details.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is inheritance?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties of the existing class into the new class. The existing class is called as base/parent class and the inherited class is called as derived/child class.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> Explain the purpose of the keyword volatile.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Declaring a variable volatile directs the compiler that the variable can be changed externally. Hence avoiding compiler optimization on the variable reference.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is an inline function?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A function prefixed with the keyword inline before the function definition is called as inline function. The inline functions are faster in execution when compared to normal functions as the compiler treats inline functions as macros.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is a storage class?</label>

</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label> What is role of static keyword on class member variable?</label>
